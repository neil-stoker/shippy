# README

After a brief experiment with three seperate repos for this project (annoying), discovered that most of the issues were caused with Visual Studio Code.

In order to stop the (frequent) issues with the linter complaining I discovered that using the `Add Folder to Workspace` options allows each of the sub-folders to behave in the way I was expecting.

The project is based upon Ewan Valentine's Microservices in Golang tutorial.

About to start [part 3 `docker-compose and datastores`.](https://ewanvalentine.io/microservices-in-golang-part-3/)
